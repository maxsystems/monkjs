## Modules overview

Monitoring provides different methods to monitor mesurement of application and helps to log errors occurred in the application.

## Implementation Guild

To implement monitoring in your application, user has to wrap entire application with ```MonitoringProvider``` as shown below.

```
<MonitoringProvider config={config}><App /></MonitoringProvider>
```

Where config object has different configuration values which helps user to configure monitoring in your application. The config object consist of below parameters.

```
export interface MonitoringConfig {
  /**
   * DSN key for sentry.io application
  */
  dsn: string;
  /**
   * The current environment of your application (e.g. "production")
  */
  environment: string;
  /**
   * Enable debug functionality in the SDK itself
  */
  debug: boolean;
  /**
   * Sample rate to determine trace sampling.
   *
   * 0.0 = 0% chance of a given trace being sent (send no traces) 1.0 = 100% chance of a given trace being sent (send
   * all traces)
   *
   * Tracing is enabled if either this or `tracesSampler` is defined. If both are defined, `tracesSampleRate` is
   * ignored.
  */
  tracesSampleRate: number;
  /**
   * Array of all the origin to browser trace.
  */
  tracingOrigins: Array<string>;
}
```

Once configured, user just has to use custom hooks ```useMonitoring()``` which exose the ```setMonitoringUser, errorHandler, measurePerformance and setMeasurement``` functions which is used for setting current user in monitoring, error handling, measuring performance of functionality and setting custom measurements in the application.

Here are the details about both functions.

**setMonitoringUser**

```
setMonitoringUser(id);
```

This function will add current user to monitoring application so that whenever users measure any performance or set a custom measurements in the monitoring, at that time we will have a all the transaction under current user. It will help us to identify the transaction based on user.

**errorHandler**

```
errorHandler(err);
```

This function will log details in monitoring application whenever it happens in the application.

**measurePerformance**

```
const capture = measurePerformance(name, operation, data);
capture()
```

Where name is the module name for which we want to measure performance. Operation is the functionality of the module and data is optional field that needed to be send to the transaction. It will return function which is used to close the transaction at the end and will measure data and store in monitoring application.

**setMeasurement**

```
const capture = setMeasurement(transactionName, name, value, unit);
capture()
```

Where transactionName will be the name of transaction for which user wants to add measurements, name is the module name for which we want to measure data, value will be the value of the measurements in number and unit will be used as unit for the current measurement.
