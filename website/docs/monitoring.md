## Modules overview

The monitoring module provides different methods to monitor errors and measure metrics in the application.

## Implementation Guild

To implement `Monk` monitoring in an application, the entire application must be wrapped with a `MonitoringProvider`.

```javascript
<MonitoringProvider config={config}>
  <App />
</MonitoringProvider>
```

The configuration options are listed below :

## MonitoringConfig

| **Config option**        | **Required** | **Type**                    | **Description**                              |
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `dsn`                    |  âœ“           | string                      | DSN key for sentry.io application            |
| `environment`            |  âœ“           | string                      | The current environment of your application  |
| `debug`                  |  âœ“           | boolean                     | Enable debug functionality in the SDK itself |
| `tracesSampleRate`       |  âœ“           | number                      | Sample rate to determine trace sampling      |
| `tracingOrigins`         |  âœ“           | string[]                    | Array of all the origin to browser trace     |

Once configured, user just has to use custom hooks ```useMonitoring()``` which exposes the ```setMonitoringUser, setMonitoringTag, errorHandler, measurePerformance and setMeasurement``` functions which are used for setting current user in monitoring, error handling, measuring performance of functionality and setting custom measurements in the application.

The details of these functions are listed below :

### `setMonitoringUser`

```typescript
setMonitoringUser(id: string): void;
```

This function will add current user to monitoring application so that whenever users measure any performance or set a custom measurements in the monitoring, at that time we will have a all the transaction under current user. It will help us to identify the transaction based on user.

### `setMonitoringTag`

```typescript
setMonitoringTag(key: string, value: Primitive): void;
```

This function will allow user to add custom tags to current transaction for query. Primitive is a datatype which contains "number | string | boolean | bigint | symbol | null | undefined" value.

### `errorHandler`

```typescript
errorHandler(err): string | null;
```

This function will log details in monitoring application whenever it happens in the application.

### `measurePerformance`

```typescript
const capture = measurePerformance(name: string, op: string, data?: { [key: string]: number | string }): SentryTransactionObject;
```

Where name is the module name for which we want to measure performance. Operation is the functionality of the module and data is optional field that needed to be send to the transaction. It will return a object which contains different functions to use in current transaction. Here are the functions which will be return as an object.

## SentryTransactionObject

| **Config option**        | **Params**                                                   | **Description**                                                                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `setTag`                 | name: string, value: string                                  | Set tag in a transaction instance                                                            |
| `startSpan`              | op: string, data: { [key: string]: number | string } | null  | Create a span in a transaction instance to measure the performance for a sub event           |
| `finishSpan`             | op: string                                                   | Finish a running span in a transaction instance and complete the measurement for a sub event |
| `finish`                 | status: string                                               | Finish a running transaction instance and complete the measurement for a main event          |

User can set tags, create new span and finish span & transaction at the end to send measured data to sentry. `capture.finish('Ok')`

User requires to set a delay before redirecting to another URL after the successful completion of Capture Tour. It will make sure that the transaction of "Capture Tour" is finished properly and it's data is successfully logged to Sentry.

```javascript
await new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 1000);
});
```

### `setMeasurement`

```typescript
const capture = setMeasurement(transactionName, name, value, unit);
capture()
```

Where transactionName will be the name of transaction for which user wants to add measurements, name is the module name for which we want to measure data, value will be the value of the measurements in number and unit will be used as unit for the current measurement.
